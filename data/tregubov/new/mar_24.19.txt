Мені написав чоловік на ім'я Кайл Янковський. Він - американець польського походження, і він піше вірші англійською. Просив передати його вірші для захисників Маріуполя.
Я передаю. Буде під тегом #kyle_for_ukraine
The week before Great Lent,
In parks kitchens and community centers,
Both Orthodox and Catholic have gathered together.
The young women of Kyiv are working hard—
Pouring oily diesel into vodka bottles
            (emptied on Fat Tuesday),
Packing grated Styrofoam into those same urns
            (instead of stuffing Pampushky)
Rolling their old t-shirts
            (in leu of pagac)
Plunging abandoned cars into dugout barricades
(instead of rolling Nalysynky for Cheesefare Sunday).
The nuns already set up a field hospital in the convent and sanctuary
            (no longer just a hospital for sinners).
A rosary hangs on every cot
           (for when the morphine isn’t enough).
For the never-to-be-married soldiers, the sisters of mercy will let their hair down
           (tearing their coifs and habits if necessary, to conceal hopeless wounds).
Later this week, the priests will also be busy,
Crossing mothers and grandmothers
With ashes from their heroic children, brothers, and husbands.
Babushka’s are still watching over their neighborhoods—
Cleaning church kitchens
(after cleaning their Kalashnikov),
Stitching Easter dresses 
            (after repairing rucksacks)
Crating canned meat
            (after loading magazines)
Reminding those born after the curtain fell,
Ukraine has many times prevailed.
