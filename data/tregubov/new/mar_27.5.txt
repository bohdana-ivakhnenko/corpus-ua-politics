Останні два вірші Кайла. Невеликі.
#kyle_for_ukraine
Graffiti on a Wall of a Collapsed Ukrainian School
Take up our peril, you who know,
We had no quarrel with our present foe.
Madonna of the Streets
(for the refugees on International Women’s Day)
The station master was the first to hear them.
Even though they were still miles out.
The train to Lviv rumbled not from steel wheel repetitively rolling on iron rail,
But steel resolve and iron-clad faith within.
Smoothly, soberly,
Sounding round after round—
Beneath your tender mercy we flee, Birthgiver-of-God.
Reject not our prayer in our trouble,
But deliver us from harm…*
