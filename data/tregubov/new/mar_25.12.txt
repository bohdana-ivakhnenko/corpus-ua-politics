In Sunflower Fields
(for the people of Mariupol)
Based on the World War 1 memorial poem and song, In Flander’s Fields
In Mariupol’s fields, gold sunflowers grow,
Sprouting up where children were buried, not long ago,
And with their mothers blooming, in prime of life.
Turn your faces not away from our strife.
The Spring sparrows sang, their brave hearts’ desire,
From under the shattered glass rocks ruin and mire,
The Spirit of Ukraine will never tire!
We are the dead, short days ago
Our hearts felt Ukraine’s, azure skies glow.
From cowardly lies, we senselessly die.
In war the youth always bleed and waste, on both sides.
Take up our peril with our collective foe!
Can you keep faith, with decency?
Give us justice, not just pity!
If you break faith, with us who die,
We shall not vanish from God’s sight.
Where we fall, golden sunflowers grow tall,
To remind you of us,
Who peacefully lived here,
Near Mariupol’s fields.
